#' surveyoutliers: A package to help handle outliers in sample surveys.
#'
#' At present, the only functionality is the calculation of optimal one-sided winsorizing cutoffs.
#' The main function is optimal.onesided.cutoff.bygroup. It calculates the optimal tuning parameter
#' for one-sided winsorisation, and so calculates winsorised values for a variable of interest.
#' See the help file for more details and an example.
#' The other functions will not usually be of use - they are there to be used by
#' optimal.onesided.cutoff.bygroup.
